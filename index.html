        Georgia is a small country with a great and ancient history. For
        centuries it has been a walk of life of struggle of the great empires
        because of its strategic location. However, it still managed to survive
        and maintain statehood. Humans settled here 1 800,000 years ago and the
        first European was a Homo Georgicus - a Georgian man. Starting with the
        Homo Georgicus living in the cave, the processes of evolution and
        cultural development were continuously going on here. In the II
        millennium B.C, the first Georgian states the Diaohi and Kolkha were
        formed. They were overthrown by nomadic tribes invading the north. In
        the VI-IV centuries B.C the kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia were formed.
        The power of Colchis was also reflected in ancient Greek myth, where the
        Argonauts traveled to find the Golden Fleece. The creation of Georgian
        alphabet is associated with the king of Iberia Parnavaz. The IV century
        turned out a turning point for Georgia. In 326 St. Nino Cappadocia
        introduced a new religion- Christianity in the country. The proclamation
        of Christianity as the state religion significantly determined the
        future development of the country. In the Middle Ages, the royal
        principalities were formed in Georgia, after which the struggle for
        unification began. The country was united by the greatest Georgian king
        in the XII century - David the Builder. He managed to make the region of
        Georgia the strongest state. The golden age of our country is considered
        to be the period of King Tamar's reign. At this time, the country's
        power and development reached its peak. The strengthening of the country
        has led to the flourishing of medieval Georgian architecture, painting
        and poetry. The Golden Age was followed by the decline, collapse, and
        domination of Iran and the Ottomans. In the XVIII century Eastern
        Georgia was united again and gained independence, though for a short
        time. Due to future threats, by the Treaty of Georgievsk in 1783, the
        kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti became the Protectorate of Russia, and in 1801
        it became its regular governorate. In 1918, after the overthrow of the
        Russian Empire, Georgia gained political independence. But freedom did
        not last long. In 1921, Soviet Russia occupied Georgia. After centuries
        of unequal struggles, in 1991 Georgia finally gained independence.
        However, the bloodshed and struggle for survival did not end with
        independence. Since the 1990s, after the war in Abkhazia, the region of
        Abkhazia has used de facto independence from Georgia and is entirely
        dependent on the Russian Federation. In 1991-1992, hostilities also
        developed in the Tskhinvali region, where the separatist forces declared
        independence under the name - "The Soviet Democratic Republic of South
        Ossetia". After Russian-Georgian war in 2008, Russian Federation,
        Nicaragua, Venezuela and Nauru recognized independence of “The Republic
        of South Ossetia” and the entire territory of the region is still
        controlled by the Russian occupation army. Georgia has endured invasions
        of such great empires as Byzantium, Persia, the Mongol Empire, the
        Ottoman Empire, and others. Despite the constant gale that has been
        going on for millennia, Georgia is a country that never loses its
        vitality and thirst for freedom. It struggles to move forward and never
        gives up.
